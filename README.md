This is a simple Spring Crud Application where:
  we create a student Entity, this is used for connecting with DB which is "MySQL"
  Then we create an Interface whch has methods declared in it. 
  Then we create the implementation of the interface, which defines the methods what they do.

Then we use CommandLineRunner to instantiate out studentDAO interface and we call the methods defined in it using it. 
Not the best approach but a simple one to understand the workflow of the code.
